                   Here are some pictures of my Rubik's cubes. I haven't solved them much during the past year and honestly forgot hot to solve the more obscure ones, but I will include a brief description, my approximate solve time, a subjective and relative difficulty evaluation, and what I think is the most difficult part about learning the puzzle.

                           The classic 3x3 Rubik's Cube, get a proper "speed cube" with better tolerances and smoother turning for the best experience.
