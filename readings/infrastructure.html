                    I took a picture of what appears to be our old internet junction box from COX near our house (we use Verizon now) and a picture of the service wires running through our neighborhood. My town has pretty sparse population so I didn't see anybody in the neighborhood, and it was raining a bit when I was taking the pictures. I don't have access to a car right now and the nearest cell tower was not within reasonable walking distance, so I took the pictures within my neightborhood.

                    Some of the internet infrastructures readings reminded me of stuff I've seen in some networking related videos before, although I have forgotten most of the techinical details. I was not aware of all the infrastructure that provides us internet access, and thought having Wi-Fi and "Cloud" services were almost magic, but there are a lot going on behind the scenes.

                    A YouTube channel called LinusTechTips also does a decent amount of server content, and seeing his media company needing so many fancy computer equipments for their server gave me a glimpse of what is going on in all the data centers with entire isles of server computers.

                    The Low Tech Magazine page is also very interesting, and I'm surprised that they were able to run a publically accessable website off such a tiny and efficient computer. I have played with Raspeberry Pi's before and they are pretty powerful for their size, but I wouldn't trust hosting a website on them after seeing all the crazy high end computers LinusTechTips used for their servers, and this website shed some light on the other end of the web server spectrum.

                    Having the webpage relying on the local weather and only serving very limited content makes the hosting model not applicable for all websites (having Canvas or Google Drive failing before homework deadlines would stink) but is certaily nice for small personal websites, and raising awareness about the hidden environmental impact of the modern internet is great.
